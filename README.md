## 📌 About the Dataset

The MPG dataset contains fuel economy data for various car models, including:
- Engine specifications (cylinders, horsepower, displacement)
- Fuel efficiency (MPG)
- Vehicle weight and acceleration
- Model year and origin

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load and explore the MPG dataset in Google Colab
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends and relationships in the data
- Gain insights into fuel efficiency patterns
